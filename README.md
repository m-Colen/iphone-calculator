# iPhone Calculator

## This project is my attempt at creating a clone of the iPhone calculator.  

This was my first time playing around with unit testing so I figured a calculator project would be a good fit.  

I learned a lot of new things during this project such as:

* Learning to seperate my code out into more testable units.   
* Learning the difference between CJS vs ES module syntax. 
* Learning a lot more about Node.js for testing and how to use the assert library.  
* Learning how to use mocha to test my results.  

Overall, this was a really fun project and helped me to explore the world of unit testing.
